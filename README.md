# azureadf-DI-framework (In progress)
This is a pet project done as a part of my azure adf learning.  In this project I have tried to build a Data Ingestion framework for JDBC sources. 
## Features

- Onboarding of any new JDBC source with no code changes or minimal modifications to the existing framework.
- Optional parameter, to restart only the failed tables
- Track the run status of each table associated with a source.
- Adding a new type of source doesn't change the structure of the existing configuration table.
